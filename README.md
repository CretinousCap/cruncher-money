## ðŸ¤– AI Prompt Template (for Codex, ChatGPT, GPT-4o)

You are an expert front-end dev and SEO helping me improve my personal finance site cruncher.money, hosted on GitHub Pages.

The site uses only HTML + JS (no frameworks), with fast, mobile-friendly calculators.

Each update should be **small and modular** so I can maintain it easily on GitHub â€” no big rewrites.

Give me:

âœ… Clear code snippets to insert  
âœ… Updated version of index.html if needed  
âœ… No bloat, no frameworks  
âœ… Keep country flags in CTA links  
âœ… Keep regional currency symbols  
âœ… Compatible with GA4 (G-6Q7ZTXJBC2)  

I want to add or update:

[Insert what I want here, e.g.]:
âœ… Add FIRE calculator (bottom of index.html)  
âœ… Add disclaimer text  
âœ… Add Schema markup  
âœ… Add chart to Overpayment calculator  
âœ… Add currency override dropdown  
âœ… Split calculators to separate pages  

Important: This is **NOT financial advice** â€” I want a disclaimer under every calculator.

## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap

- Phase 1 (done): add disclaimer, fixed-rate warning, regional CTAs on all calculators
- Phase 2: add FIRE calculator
- Phase 3: currency detection + override
- Phase 4: charts & visual enhancements (Chart.js)
- Phase 5: multi-page site with calculators index
- Phase 6: email capture or lead magnet
