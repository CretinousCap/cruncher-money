  <h1>FIRE Calculator UK / Ireland — How to use &amp; plan your FIRE goal</h1>
  <p><strong>What is FIRE?</strong></p>
  <p>FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It’s a growing movement of people who aim to save and invest enough so that they can stop working — or work only if they want to — well before the traditional retirement age.</p>
  <p>In simple terms, FIRE is about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Saving aggressively during your working years</li>
    <li>✅ Keeping your spending low</li>
    <li>✅ Investing your savings wisely</li>
    <li>✅ Reaching a “FIRE number” — the amount you need invested to live off, year after year</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How to use this FIRE Calculator</strong></p>
  <p>This calculator helps you estimate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ How much you need to reach your FIRE number</li>
    <li>✅ How many years it might take, based on your savings rate</li>
    <li>✅ The impact of changing your expenses or investment returns</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You’ll need to enter:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your current invested savings</li>
    <li>Your target annual expenses (post-FIRE)</li>
    <li>Your monthly savings</li>
    <li>Expected annual return on investments</li>
    <li>Target number of years — or let the calculator estimate it for you</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Tips for using the calculator</strong></p>
  <p>Be realistic about your post-FIRE expenses — don’t forget healthcare, housing, or hobbies!</p>
  <p>Investment returns can vary — conservative estimates (4–6%) are often safest.</p>
  <p>Review your plan yearly — as markets and life can change.</p>
  <p>Many FIRE followers use a “safe withdrawal rate” of 3.5–4% — this calculator helps you model that.</p>
